# High School Programming Projects - C++ Language

This collection of projects contains programs written in the C++ language as part of high school coursework. Each project illustrates various programming and algorithmic concepts.

## Project List

* **caesar\_cipher.cpp:** Implementation of the Caesar cipher, a simple encryption method that shifts each letter of the plaintext by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.
* **decimal\_converter.cpp:** A program to convert numbers between different numeral systems (e.g., decimal, binary, hexadecimal).
* **fraction\_operations.cpp:** Implementation of basic arithmetic operations on fractions (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
* **merge\_sort\_algorithm.cpp:** Implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm, an efficient sorting method based on the "divide and conquer" strategy.
* **palindrome\_checker.cpp:** A program that checks whether a given word, phrase, or number is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).
* **prime\_check\_related.cpp:** A collection of functions or programs related to checking the properties of prime numbers, such as primality testing or generating prime numbers.
* **prime\_checker.cpp:** A program that determines whether a given number is a prime number.
* **prime\_test.cpp:** Likely another variant of a program for testing the primality of numbers or a set of tests verifying the operation of a prime number checking algorithm.
* **quadratic\_roots.cpp:** A program that calculates the real and complex roots of a quadratic equation in the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$.
* **random\_array\_sum.cpp:** A program that creates an array filled with random numbers and calculates the sum of its elements.
* **randomize\_sort\_and\_merge.cpp:** A program that demonstrates randomizing elements into arrays, sorting these arrays (likely using bubble sort or another simple algorithm), and merging two sorted arrays into one.
* **star\_triangle.cpp:** A program that draws various patterns of triangles made of asterisk characters (`*`) on the screen based on input data (e.g., size, triangle type).
* **temperature\_analysis.cpp:** A program for analyzing temperature data, potentially calculating statistics such as the average, minimum, and maximum temperatures from a given dataset.
* **train\_cargo\_query.cpp:** A program for managing information about trains and their cargo, allowing for searching, filtering, or displaying information based on specific criteria.

## Project Structure

Each project is located in a separate C++ source file (`.cpp`). These files contain the implementation of the described programming problem.

## How to Use

To compile and run these programs, you will need a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).

1.  **Open a terminal or command prompt.**
2.  **Navigate to the directory containing the `.cpp` files.**
3.  **Compile the desired file using the g++ compiler:**
    ```bash
    g++ filename.cpp -o executable_name
    ```
    Example for `caesar_cipher.cpp`:
    ```bash
    g++ caesar_cipher.cpp -o caesar_cipher
    ```
4.  **Run the compiled program:**
    ```bash
    ./executable_name
    ```
    Example:
    ```bash
    ./caesar_cipher
    ```
5.  **Follow the instructions displayed by the program (if required).**

## Additional Information

These projects represent a record of my initial experiences with programming in the C++ language during my high school education. Each one helped me understand basic and more advanced programming concepts.
